# Make playlists inn Spotify using their API.
While functional, this will currently not work beacuse I have not added Client ID or Secret.
If you add your own, this will be functional.
Also it looks really bad visually because I have not added much CSS, yet.
Once I have a better understanding of servers and security I will revisit this project.

Also, the code to get the access key is copied by a tutorial given by Spotify as documented in the code.
